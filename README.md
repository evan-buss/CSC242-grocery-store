# CSC242-grocery-store

Final product that I was graded on, it works, but it requires a database on the school's network,  you can visit the [website](http://unixweb.kutztown.edu/~ebuss376/store.php) to check it out.

I will be completely rewriting it over the summer to look more modern and implement a new database backend.

The website colors are based on the Dracula text editor theme.
